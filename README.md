# workflows
[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/SciTools/workflows/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/SciTools/workflows/main)

Common [reusable GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) to be called from other `SciTools` repositories.

## License

`workflows` is distributed under the terms of the [BSD-3-Clause](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) license.

## CLA

The [**CLA**](https://cla-assistant.io/SciTools/) check will run on pull
requests, as with the rest of SciTools, but the CLA is NOT part of any
branch protection rule as this would block the workflow of merging directly
to `main`.
